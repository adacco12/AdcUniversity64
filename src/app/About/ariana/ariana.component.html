  Ariana Grande-Butera (/ˌɑːriˈɑːnə ˈɡrɑːndeɪ/; born June 26, 1993) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Born in Florida to a family of Italian origin, she began her career in 2008 in the Broadway musical 13, before playing the role of Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious from 2010 to 2013, and in the spinoff Sam & Cat from 2013 to 2014. Grande made her first musical appearance on the soundtrack for Victorious and was signed to Republic Records in 2011 after music executive Monte Lipman came across one of her YouTube videos covering songs.  <br />

  Grande released her debut album Yours Truly in 2013, which was influenced by 1990s R&B and '60s doo-wop, and peaked atop the US Billboard 200. Grande ventured into EDM on her second album, My Everything (2014), which also topped the US charts and featured four top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, the most by any artist in 2014; "Problem", "Break Free", "Bang Bang", and "Love Me Harder". Her third album, Dangerous Woman (2016), explored pop and dance, and became her first number-one album in the United Kingdom. She experimented with trap on her fourth album, Sweetener (2018), which topped several album charts around the world. Both albums produced the successful singles "Side to Side" and "No Tears Left to Cry" respectively. Her upcoming fifth studio album, Thank U, Next, is scheduled to be released in February 2019. The title track was released as the lead single and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, while the second single, "7 Rings", broke several streaming records. Grande is the first artist in the history of the chart to have the lead singles from each of their first five studio albums debut within the top-ten on the US charts.
